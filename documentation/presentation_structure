Intro
    Your team
     # Pondering our name, we looked at our surroundings for inspiration.  We clocked the Manchester Bees on the wallpaper and it struck a chord – busy, collecting, creating, working.
     # Manchester Bees, busy bees, worker bees, honey bees – we are the Tech Returner Bees
     # It has certainly been a Hive of activity.
    
    Yourself
    # Helen: Mum to Dominic.  Used to do technical things but drifted away.  Wondering now how and why she let that happen

Why
    The problem
    # According to Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) Over third of all food produced globally goes to waste. 
    # In the UK, seven million tonnes of that waste (five million of which is perfectly edible) is created by households.
    # A significant impact on climate change (an equivalent carbon footprint of 22 million tonnes)
    # The average family of four could save £70 per month by reducing their food waste.

   The solution
   # There are many things that can be done to reduce waste but our project assists with: meal planning and using leftovers
   # Using up food is a current issue / on peoples' minds
   # Market research on social media when pooling ideas for our project came up with:
   #"recipe suggestions for the random ingredients I have that need using up" and "I've tried many times to find that kind of thing based on the random mushroom anchovy broccoli ingredients I have lying around"

   The decision
   # We considered:
   # whether our audience would understand what we were trying to deliver
   # any commercial viability
   # ease of build and whether we understood the technology
   # would it showcase all our skills
   # could we make it look good
   # could it split down into chunks so that we could do a phased delivery
   # Our project also required accessing a third party API which we didn't do on the course - we wanted that challenge.
   # We had a couple of feasible ideas and took a democratic vote (having consulted with James)

   
How - Our Story
   # We quickly assigned responsibilites (based on personal preference), 2 on back-end, 2 on front
   # Communication was done mostly via Slack with some physical meet ups (with cookies)
   # The first step was ensure that a third party recipe API we had found would allow us to deliver something
   # We built a proof of concept in React that accessed Edamam succesfully - great - now fully committed to our idea
   # Front end could progress
   # Meanwhile the back-end team carried out a quick study  on other APIs to make sure we were using the most appropriate
   # It was also important to show that we could create a database and build an API to access that so the back team worked on that aspect.

   API Selection
   # We assessed around 8 recipe APIs
   # A couple we were able to discount as they were being decommissioned
   # We discounted (for now) anything we had to pay for!
   # Since we had started with Edamam (and assessed that as suitable) we discounted anything that had less functionality
   # In the end the only real contender was Spoonacular which we unanimously agreed to discount as it was more fiddly to use (and required a double pass to get data we wanted) and threatened to put our timescales at risk.
   # Spoonacular should be considered if we further developed as it appeared to access more data of a better quality.
   # We had to rememeber we were developing a minimum viable product.

    Challenges / lessons learned
    # Christmas
    # General family/school/job balancing
    # The API accesses third party websites so data quality can be inconsistent

    Future road map
    # move external api call to backend (currently calling from frontend) so that
       a) the api key and api id are not passed in plain text
       b) we can improve performance by building a proxy to get around cors-anywhere issue.
    # review the API used
