Intro
    Your team
     #Pondering our name, we looked at our surroundings for inspiration.  We clocked the Manchester Bees on the wallpaper and it struck a chord – busy, collecting, creating, working.
     #Manchester Bees, busy bees, worker bees, honey bees – we are the Tech Returner Bees
     #It has certainly been a Hive of activity.
    
    Yourself
    #Helen: Mum to Dominic.  Used to do technical things but drifted away.  Wondering now how and why she let that happen

Why
    The problem
    # According to Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) Over third of all food produced globally goes to waste. 
    # In the UK, seven million tonnes of that waste (five million of which is perfectly edible) is created by households.
    # A significant impact on climate change (an equivalent carbon footprint of 22 million tonnes)
    # The average family of four could save £70 per month by reducing their food waste.

   /* The solution

    Why we chose – third party api, a subject that people could identify with
    Customer research
    #We headed to social media when pooling ideas for our project
    #"recipe suggestions for the random ingredients I have that need using up " and "I've tried many times to find that kind of thing based on the random mushroom anchovy broccoli ingredients I have lying around"
