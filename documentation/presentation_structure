Intro
    Your team
     # Pondering our name, we looked at our surroundings for inspiration.  We clocked the Manchester Bees on the wallpaper and it struck a chord – busy, collecting, creating, working.
     # Manchester Bees, busy bees, worker bees, honey bees – we are the Tech Returner Bees
     # It has certainly been a Hive of activity.
    
    Yourself
    # Helen: Mum to Dominic.  Used to do technical things but drifted away.  Wondering now how and why she let that happen

Why
    The problem
    # According to Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) Over third of all food produced globally goes to waste. 
    # In the UK, seven million tonnes of that waste (five million of which is perfectly edible) is created by households.
    # A significant impact on climate change (an equivalent carbon footprint of 22 million tonnes)
    # The average family of four could save £70 per month by reducing their food waste.

   The solution
   # A BBC article recommends a three prong approach to reducing food waste one of which is meal planning
   # Using up food is a current issue / on peoples' minds
   # Market research on social media when pooling ideas for our project
   #"recipe suggestions for the random ingredients I have that need using up" and "I've tried many times to find that kind of thing based on the random mushroom anchovy broccoli ingredients I have lying around"

   The decision
   # We had a couple of feasible ideas and took a democratic vote (having consulted with James)
   # We chose a project that we felt the general public could identify with
   # Our project also required accessing a third party API which we didn't do on the course - we wanted that challenge.
